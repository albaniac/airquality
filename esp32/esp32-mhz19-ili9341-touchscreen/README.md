Update 28.01.2020:

Strugled with mqtt client, because if you forget word "client" from async def mqtt_subscribe(client) sub, error message in MQTT_AS.py line 538 gave "function takes 0 positional arguments but 1 were given" error and I was too blind to see it. Now mqtt publish works fine and data can be collected to the inxludb and grafana. Continuing with screens. Available memory seems to hold somewhere in 20 000 range. 


27.01.2020.

This is first running version of indoor Airquality measurement device. 

Due to free ram issues variable names are refactored (shortened) and comments are removed from the code. I will update this README instead.

Operation:
- Hardware-related parameters are in the parameters.py. UART2 may have initialization problems if boot cause is power on boot. That is fixed in the code by deleting CO2 sensor object and re-creation of the object if bootcause was 1 = power on boot. For some reason 2 second pause is not enough, 5 seconds seems to work.
- Runtime-parameters are in runtimeconfig.json and my initial idea was to update this file so that user selections can be saved to the file. Now this file needs to be updated via WebREPl or via REPL.
- Network statup is asynhronous so that two SSID + PASSWORD combinations can be presented in the runtimeconfig.json. Highest rssi = signal strength AP is selected. Once network is connected = IP address is acquired, then script executes WebREPL startup and adjust time with NTPTIME. If network gets disconnected, script will redo network handshake.
- Measurement from all sensors are gathered in the background and values are filled into rows to be displayed.
- MQTT topics updates information to the broker and from broker to the InfluxDB and Grafana. 
- MQTT can be used to pick better correction multipliers for sensors.

Future:
- Add GPIO for the TFT panel LED control.
- Test if SD-slot can be used at the same time, with bit-banged softSPI for Touchscreen and hardware SPI for the SD-card.
- I try to add some trending, either so that trends are picked from Grafana as embedded graphics, or create some simple graphics, depending on free ram.
- Design case with Fusion360 to be printed with 3D-printer, adding proper air channels for sensors and perhaps litle Steveson's shield, which indoors is most likely not that important. BME280 sensor will be bottom, because heat from ESP32 SMD will go up. PMS7003 documentation recommends distance between floow and sensor > 20 cm, which means case shall be wall mounted. 
- Perhaps calculate better AirQuality etc information in the InfluxDB and return data back to device via MQTT.


Known issues:
- Due to memory allocation issues removed split screen to 4 parts, where from user was able to select next screen.
- Keyboard is not implemented, therefore touch just rotates detail screen (to be added more).
- Display update is slow due to framebuffer issue. During screen update availabe memory is low, may cause out of memory. I tried with Peter Hinch ILI9341 drivers, https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-tft-gui and https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-lcd160cr-gui but unfortunatelly with my knowledge I did not get driver working at all, resulting out of memory right in the class init. If you get them working, please, use those drivers instead of this slow driver.

Solved issues:
- Touchscreen gave strange x, y values: reason too high SPI-bus speed. Use minimum 1 MHz, maximum 2 MHz. This script uses 1.2MHz
- Toucscreen responded very slow to touch: bad DUPONT-connectors!
